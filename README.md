## How to play

[ドルフィン](https://twitter.com/Dolphinsssz), one of the organizers of [Be-Music West](http://bmwest.herokuapp.com/) created a detailed how-to-play! Here is a copy of it:

Here is an animated GIF to demonstrate: http://echo.s-ul.eu/0u33oAXQ.gif  
You then select the song and which difficulty you want to play on.  
Once you can see the play screen, hit ENTER to start playing!

You play the game using the keys [H][J][K][L][Spacebar]

[H] - Red Circle (Innermost Circle)  
[J] - Orange Circle (Second Innermost)  
[K] - Green Circle (Second Outmost)  
[L] - Blue Circle (Outermost Circle)  
[Spacebar] - Special (Centre)

If you are playing Doubles, you will need these keybinds in addition to [S][D][F][G] for the left side.  
The keybinds above will be used for the right side.

[G] - Red Circle (Innermost Circle)  
[F] - Orange Circle (Second Innermost)  
[D] - Green Circle (Second Outmost)  
[S] - Blue Circle (Outermost Circle)  
[Spacebar] will trigger both sides' special.

Anyway, I hope you enjoy this unique way of playing music games!
